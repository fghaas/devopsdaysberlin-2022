# Five paragraphs that matter

<!-- Note -->
Whenever you need to thoroughly **brief a group of people on an
important matter,** in writing, consider using a **5-paragraph
format.**

What follows is a format that is being used by many armed forces; in
NATO parlance it’s called the 5-paragraph field order.


1. Situation
2. Mission
3. Execution
4. Logistics
5. Command and Signal

<!-- Note -->
Now I’m generally not a fan of applying military thinking to civilian
life — after all we shouldn’t forget that the military is an
institution that kills people and breaks things, and I say that as a
commissioned officer in my own country’s army —, but in this case it’s
actually something that can very much be applied to professional
communications, with some rather minor modifications:


1. Situation
2. Objective
3. Plan
4. Logistics
5. Communications

<!-- Note -->
Let’s break these down in a little detail:

1. Situation is about what position we’re in, and **why** we set out
   to do what we want to do. You can break this down into three
   sub-points, like the customer’s situation, the situation of your
   own company, any extra help that is available, and the current
   market.
2. Objective is **what** we want to achieve.
3. Plan is **how** we want to achieve it.
4. Logistics is about what budget and resources are available, and how
   they are used.
5. Communications is about how you’ll be coordinating among yourselves
   and with others in order to achieve your goal.


What if that's too formal?

<!-- Note -->
Sometimes these headings may look overly formal. People who are not
used to that format might actually find it off-putting. You can
totally use more colloquial headings, to make your communication less
formal. For example:


Why am I contacting you?

What do we want to achieve?

How are we going to do that?

What will we need?

How will we communicate?

<!-- Note -->
You'll quickly notice that these map *precisely* to the
concepts of situation, objective, plan, logistics, and
communications. But they sound much more casual and informal and
approachable.
