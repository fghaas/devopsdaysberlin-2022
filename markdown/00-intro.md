# Writing Professionally
(in English)

DevOpsDays Berlin 2022

<!-- Note -->
This is a talk about developing superpowers. Superpowers that will
help you be better in any role, any industry, any profession â€”
*particularly* the ones where you work in distributed teams, and use
an asynchronous and distributed workflow.

This is about expressing yourself clearly, succinctly, and
professionally in writing. I have put this together for the English
language, though parts of this talk may be applicable to other
languages as well.

<!-- Note -->
Before I start, I do want to mention that I am with Cleura, who are
also paying my travel to be here. We are a European, privacy
conscious, open source based public cloud service provider. We are
based in Sweden, we are a distributed company, and you can work for us
from anywhere in Europe as long as you speak English and have a
working internet connection, and we're also hiring.

So if that sounds like you, please by all means come see me after the
talk and we can chat.
