One of the simplest, most concise and useful rulesets for writing
clearly in the English language come from George Orwell's 1946 essay,
*Politics and the English Language.*

In it, Orwell suggested six rules for writers to follow:


## 1
Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are
used to seeing in print.

<!-- Note -->
What Orwell means by this is essentially, "don't try to be clever". If
you're using a metaphor, chances are that it's not original, that
somebody else has used it before, and people may see it as a tedious
trope.

More importantly though, your reader might simply not be familiar with
the metaphor, depending on their background. As an example, if your
readers are from Germany, or are medieval scholars from somewhere in
Western Europe, they will probably understand what you mean by calling
a salesperson a [Pied
Piper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pied_Piper_of_Hamelin). If they
are not, your readers will be very confused by your reference to a
13th century rat exterminator (or musician, depending on viewpoint).


## 2
Never use a long word where a short one will do.

<!-- Note -->
It's remarkable how much clearer your writing gets if you ruthlessly
edit it. English almost always gives you a choice between using a long
word, and a shorter one with the same meaning. Always opt for the
short one.


I don't mean to insinuate that.  <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

I don't mean to say that.  <!-- .element class="fragment" -->


## 3
If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.

<!-- Note -->
When you're using shorter words instead of longer ones, you cut
syllables and letters from your writing. Naturally, you can also
extend that concept to cutting whole words.

### Saint-Exupéry portrait <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

<!-- Note -->

There's a famous quote that fits well with this particular rule that
comes from the French writer, poet, and aviator Antoine de
Saint-Exupéry (best known to English-speaking readers for his novella
*The Little Prince*).


### Saint-Exupéry quote (original) <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

> « Il semble que la perfection soit atteinte non quand il n'y a plus
> rien à ajouter, mais quand il n'y a plus rien à retrancher. »

Antoine de Saint-Exupéry  
(*Terre des hommes*, 1939)


### Saint-Exupéry quote (English) <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

> It appears that perfection is achieved not when there is nothing
> left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.

<!-- Note -->
It needs to be said that this quote disagrees with itself a bit...


### Saint-Exupéry quote (English, edited) <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

> ~It appears that~ Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing
> left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.

<!-- Note -->
... because it does contain a phrase that is perfectly okay to take
away, still. But it is a good quote to go by, still.


## 4
Never use the passive where you can use the active.

<!-- Note -->
Orwell's rule No. 4 states that you should be using the active voice
whenever you can. There are some exceptions to this, but in general
the active voice tends to be shorter, more concise, and thus clearer
than the passive voice.


### Rewriting passive-voice phrases in the active voice <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

The system has been rebooted.  <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

We have rebooted the system.  <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

<!-- Note -->
Sometimes, it's difficult for non-native speakers to even *recognize*
that they are using the passive voice. There's a neat little trick to
apply here: if you can take the sentence and append "by dragons" to
it, then it's passive voice.


### Saint-Exupéry quote (English, active voice) <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

> We achieve perfection not when we can't add anything, but
> when we can't take anything away.

<!-- Note -->
Of course, the quote becomes less and less poetic as we edit it. I'm
not trying to say that Saint-Exupéry ought to be writing any
differently than he did. What I'm trying to say is that in
professional communications we shouldn't be poetic, we should be
clear.


## 5
Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you
can think of an everyday English equivalent.

<!-- Note -->
Orwell's fifth rule emphasises simplicity and accessibility. If there
is an uncommon word that means *the same thing* as a common one, always
use the common one.

Note that this means that you can — and should — use technical terms
if they have *no* everyday equivalent. That's simply because using an
imprecise term would mean *losing* clarity, when compared to using a
precise term. But when we have one that we *can* easily replace with a
common word, we should do so.


### Replacing uncommon words with common ones <!-- .element class="hidden" -->
He is a pulchritudinous masculine specimen.  <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

He is a handsome guy. <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

<!-- Note -->
Here, that is the case, and we can simply replace the uncommon terms
with common once.

Another example in the corporate world is that we can easily replace
the jargon term "human resources" with "people":

* For this project we'll need to acquire more human resources.
* For this project we'll need to hire more people.


## 6
Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.

<!-- Note -->
And finally, Orwell reminds us that while this ruleset is a good
guideline to follow, it is not absolute.
