One of the simplest, most concise and useful rulesets for writing
clearly in the English language come from George Orwell's 1946 essay,
*Politics and the English Language.*

In it, Orwell suggested six rules for writers to follow:


## 1
Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are
used to seeing in print.

<!-- Note -->
What Orwell means by this is essentially, "don't try to be clever". If
you're using a metaphor, chances are that it's not original, that
somebody else has used it before, and people may see it as a tedious
trope.

More importantly though, your reader might simply not be familiar with
the metaphor, depending on their background. As an example, if your
readers are from Germany, or are medieval scholars from somewhere in
Western Europe, they will probably understand what you mean by calling
a salesperson a [Pied
Piper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pied_Piper_of_Hamelin). If they
are not, your readers will be very confused by your reference to a
13th century rat exterminator (or musician, depending on viewpoint).


## 2
Never use a long word where a short one will do.


I don't mean to insinuate that.  <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

I don't mean to say that.  <!-- .element class="fragment" -->


## 3
If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.

### Saint-Exupéry quote (original) <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

> « Il semble que la perfection soit atteinte non quand il n'y a plus
> rien à ajouter, mais quand il n'y a plus rien à retrancher. »

Antoine de Saint-Exupéry  
(*Terre des hommes*, 1939)


### Saint-Exupéry quote (English) <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

> It seems that perfection is achieved not when there is nothing left
> to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.


### Saint-Exupéry quote (English, edited) <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

> ~It seems that~ Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing
> left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.


## 4
Never use the passive where you can use the active.


### Rewriting passive-voice phrases in the active voice <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

The system has been rebooted.  <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

We have rebooted the system.  <!-- .element class="fragment" -->


### Saint-Exupéry quote (English, active voice) <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

> We achieve perfection not when we can't add anything, but
> when we can't take anything away.

<!-- Note -->
Of course, the quote becomes less and less poetic as we edit it. I'm
not trying to say that Saint-Exupéry ought to be writing any
differently than he did. What I'm trying to say is that in
professional communications we shouldn't be poetic, we should be
clear.


## 5
Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you
can think of an everyday English equivalent.


He is a pulchritudinous masculine specimen.  <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

He is a handsome guy. <!-- .element class="fragment" -->


## 6
Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.
