One of the simplest, most consise and useful rulesets for writing
clearly in the English language come from George Orwell's 1946 essay,
*Politics and the English Language.*

In it, Orwell suggested six rules for writers to follow:


## 1
Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.


## 2
Never use a long word where a short one will do.


## 3
If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.


## 4
Never use the passive where you can use the active.


## 6
Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you
can think of an everyday English equivalent.


## 6
Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.
