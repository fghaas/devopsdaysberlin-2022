# Little things


## Parallelism

(parallel structure)


We wanted to know the time, the place, and where we were going.  <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

We wanted to know the time, the place, and the destination. <!-- .element class="fragment" -->


## Emphasis goes last


The drug is highly effective,  
but has significant side effects.  <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

The drug has significant side effects,  
but is highly effective. <!-- .element class="fragment" -->


## Effectively using bullets in a sentence


It is important that we listen to the customer's needs, build a good
solution that keeps us within the applicable regulatory framework, and
clearly delineate responsibilities in the proposal and SLA.


It is important that we 

* listen to the customers needs, 
* build a good solution that keeps us within the applicable regulatory
framework, and
* clearly delineate responsibilities in the proposal and SLA.


## Writing positively


The project manager may not hire outside contractors except those that
have been carefully vetted for reliability.  <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

The project manager must vet all outside contractors for
reliability. <!-- .element class="fragment" -->


## Punctuation


### Whitespace

Whitespace always goes *after* punctuation,  
never before.


### Question marks (?)

Questions should end in a question mark,  
shouldn't they?


### Exclamation marks (!)

Use no more than one explanation mark per paragraph. 

Zero is fine, too.


### Semicolons

Semicolons are great; splitting the sentence in two is usually better.


### Possessive apostrophe

Cleuras: more than one Cleura <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

Cleura's: of or related to Cleura <!-- .element class="fragment" -->


### it's vs. its

it's: it is (or it has) <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

its: of it <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

(Yes, this is illogical and immensely confusing. English is weird.) <!-- .element class="fragment" -->


### Parentheses

Parentheses (like these) are always removable, without taking anything
(of significant value) away from the statement.


### Square brackets

You can use square brackets to shorten quotes.

> To be, or not to be. That is the question. [...] To die, to
> sleep. No more!


### Angle brackets

Angle brackets often serve as placeholders, for when the reader must
replace &lt;important thing&gt; with &lt;other thing&gt;.


### Hyphens and dashes

A hyphen joins word-pairs together.  <!-- .element class="fragment" --> 

En dashes identify ranges or dates (March – June).  <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

Em dashes — like this — can replace parentheses.  <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
