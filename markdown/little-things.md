# Little things

<!-- Note -->
Let's look at a few other, small things that you can think about to
make your writing better.


## Parallelism

(parallel structure)

<!-- Note -->
Parallelism is the simple rule that if you are using a particular
structure in a sentence, then you keep using that structure until the
end of the sentence.


We wanted to know the time, the place, and where we were going.  <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

We wanted to know the time, the place, and the destination. <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

<!-- Note -->
In this example, the first sentence is correct English, even though it
may be a little colloquial.

The second sentence is clearer, because the use of "we wanted to know
the time, the place, and" primes the reader to expect another
instance of the definite article "the", followed by a noun. Finishing
the sentence by "the destination" makes for a more straightforward
reading experience.


## Emphasis goes last


The drug is highly effective,  
but has significant side effects.  <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

The drug has significant side effects,  
but is highly effective. <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

<!-- Note -->
Most English speakers subconsciously read the end of a sentence as
being more important than its beginning. Thus, whatever you consider
the more important aspect should go at the end of the sentence for
emphasis.


## Effectively using bullets in a sentence

<!-- Note -->
In professional writing, you often have the opportunity to make a long
sentence much more readable, by simply injecting bullets.


It is important that we listen to the customer's needs, build a good
solution that keeps us within the applicable regulatory framework, and
clearly delineate responsibilities in the proposal and SLA.

<!-- Note -->
This is a long run-on sentence, which most readers will have diffculty
grasping at a glance.


It is important that we 

* listen to the customers needs, 
* build a good solution that keeps us within the applicable regulatory
framework, and
* clearly delineate responsibilities in the proposal and SLA.

<!-- Note -->
In this version, *not a single word has changed.* But most people will
find reading this version much easier than reading the original. That
is because most readers will be able to grap the initial part of the
sentence, "it is important that we" at a single glance, and will also
be able to do the same with the three bullets.

That is to say that without even reading it in full, your reader will
grasp that you are about to mention what's important, and that there
are three things you suggest to consider.


## Writing positively


The project manager may not hire outside contractors except those that
have been carefully vetted for reliability.  <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

The project manager must vet all outside contractors for
reliability. <!-- .element class="fragment" -->


## Punctuation

... does matter. Really.


### Eats shoots and leaves  <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

The panda eats bamboo shoots and leaves.

<!-- Note -->
Here we are dealing with a perfectly normal panda.


### Eats shoots, and leaves  <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

The panda eats bamboo shoots, and leaves.

<!-- Note -->
This panda is a picky eater who takes off after eating the bamboo
shoots, rather than also eating the bamboo leaves.


### Eats, shoots, and leaves  <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

The panda eats bamboo, shoots, and leaves.

<!-- Note -->
And this panda is a gun nut with an anger management problem.


### Whitespace

Whitespace always goes *after* punctuation,  
never before.


### Question marks (?)

Questions should end in a question mark,  
shouldn't they?


### Exclamation marks (!)

Use no more than one explanation mark per paragraph. 

Zero is fine, too.


### Semicolons

Semicolons are great; splitting the sentence in two is usually better.


### Possessive apostrophe

Cleuras: more than one Cleura <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

Cleura's: of or related to Cleura <!-- .element class="fragment" -->


### it's vs. its

it's: it is (or it has) <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

its: of it <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

<!-- Note -->
Yes, this is illogical and immensely confusing. English is weird.


### Parentheses

Parentheses (like these) are always removable, without taking anything
(of significant value) away from the statement.


### Square brackets

You can use square brackets to shorten quotes.

> To be, or not to be. That is the question. [...] To die, to
> sleep. No more!


### Angle brackets

Angle brackets often serve as placeholders, for when the reader must
replace &lt;important thing&gt; with &lt;other thing&gt;.


### Hyphens and dashes

A hyphen joins word-pairs together.  <!-- .element class="fragment" --> 

En dashes identify ranges or dates (March – June).  <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

Em dashes — like this — can replace parentheses.  <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
