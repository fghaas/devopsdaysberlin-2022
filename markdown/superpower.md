## The #1 Awesome Writing Superpower


## No for real


Read things out loud.

<!-- Note -->
I am dead serious about this one. It's pretty safe to say that
**nothing** will improve your writing as much as getting into the
habit of reading things out loud as you edit.

There are a number of reasons for this:

* You can read silently at about 250 words per minute, but you can
  speak at only about 150. Reading things out loud deliberately slows
  down your reading, and gives you a better chance to spot your own
  errors.

* Forcing yourself to speak what you wrote will make it easy to detect
  errors in flow, run-on sentences, and confusing phrases. You will
  naturally want to correct these, and it will make your writing
  better.
  
* Making time to read what you write simply means your mind will stay
  on topic longer than when you just bash something out and
  immediately send or publish it. This additional time gives you the
  opportunity to spot more mistakes, detect errors in your thinking,
  and *have better ideas*.

Do not squander all those opportunities. Read things out loud.
